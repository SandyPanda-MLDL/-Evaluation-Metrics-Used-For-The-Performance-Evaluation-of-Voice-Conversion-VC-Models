# Evaluation Metrics Used For The Performance Evaluation of Voice Conversion VC Models
 
Voice Conversion (VC) has been a prominent subject of research in the science of speech synthesis in recent years as a result of its growing use in voice-assistance technology, automated movie dubbing, and speech-to-singing conversion, to mention a few applications.
VC is concerned with the conversion of one speaker's vocal style to that of another while maintaining the linguistic content. The speech analysis, speech feature mapping, and speech reconstruction stages of the VC job are accomplished in a three-stage pipeline. For voice feature mapping from source to target speaker, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models are now commonly used. Evolution of models will enhance the quality of synthesized speech and also will enable real world application of VC commercially and also in medical field. To ensure that the reproduced speech holds the characteristics of the voice and error are minimized to produce the finest quality , we need evaluation metrics to govern the quality.
Thus the presented models can elegantly execute the voice conversion task by attaining high speaker similarity and appropriate speech quality, according to subjective and objective evaluations of the generated speech samples.

### The following files represent the various objecvtive and subjective evaluation metrics that can be used in Voice Conversion.

* MCD 
* F0 RMSE
* log F0 RMSE
* MSD
* SNR
* PESQ
* GV
* MCEP Trajectory
* Modulation Spectrum
* Mean MCEP 
* MCEP Scatter Plot
